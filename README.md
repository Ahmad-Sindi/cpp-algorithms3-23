# Algorithm Challenge #23 – Print First Letter of Each Word (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a full line of text and prints the first letter
of each word in the string.

Instead of splitting the string into words, the solution scans
the text character by character while tracking word boundaries.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Processing strings without built-in split functions
- Detecting word boundaries using state tracking
- Working with characters and ASCII values
- Writing efficient text-parsing algorithms
- Applying clean and readable logic for string problems

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**

Enter your text:

Hello world from C++

**Output:**
H  
w  
f  
C

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** print_first_letter_each_word.cpp
- **Challenge Number:** #23
- **Level:** 3

💬 Notes
-
This challenge highlights an important engineering principle:
string problems are often state problems.

By tracking whether we are at the beginning of a word, we avoid extra memory usage and keep the solution efficient and clean.
